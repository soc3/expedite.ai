#### Bridging the gap between social media and customer support

## Problem
These days, customers often use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc. to register their complaints by directly commenting on their posts. These Facebook posts/comments which often talk about their issues(often in a negative way) results in negative publicity and a cynical image of the seller.

## Solution

![Expedite.ai aims to reduce this problem of reputation degradation by monitoring Facebook posts. Using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, we analyze comments and classify them into different categories (payment issue, the delivery problem etc), and extract relevant entities. The Facebook comments/posts/messages are given a priority based on their weights (calculated using views, likes, shares, comments etc on that particular post).](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshub16/expedite.ai/b8025fdccbabe06ae40bbd906e691b95db54d7eb/static/homepage.png?token=ASVjehujVZzTbD5gIotF3jzoHkcnb4VFks5Z_ryywA%3D%3D)

The support staff is informed of these posts in order of priority (high priority first, in order to curb the damage). The support staff can monitor this activity on their real time dashboard, reply to the comments and close the issues.

## Result

As a result, the time and money spent in continuously monitoring the social media is considerably reduced. Also, the problems of the customers are addressed as soon as possible, resulting in better customer experience.
